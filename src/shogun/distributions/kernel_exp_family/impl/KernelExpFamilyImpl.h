/* TODO
 *
 * -  The kernel can be optional later on. For now we can just fix it (too many
 *   derivatives to be implemented for now.). We can make it a simple class where
 *   people who want other kernels can overload methods in.
 *   NOTE: Some functions should should take a reference to the return type as
 *         parameter, which allows for pre-allocation of that memory.
 *         Should investigate whether that is needed before doing it. There might
 *         be a few cases where we can avoid using double memory usage peaks for the
 *         big matrices.
 * - There are various TODOs in the code that address the question whether
 *   vectorization makes sense. Check these.
 * - The Gaussian kernel implemented should get doxygen math of what it does,
 *   in particular in the derivatives.
 * - Benchmark and profile the code and investigate in particular whether it has
 *   a lot of cache misses and how we can avoid that. Investigate how it scales
 *   with multiple cores. Investigate how much memory it uses for larger datasets.
 * - Profile memory usage of full vs Nystrom.
 * - Nystrom can be slower than full (N=1000, D=5). Why is that?
 *
 *   Optimizations:
 * - See the various TODOs in the code
 * - Nystrom: Does it make sense to store another (subsetted) copy of the data
 *   to increase speed when looping over it?
 * - How does openmp parallelization affect speed (ask Rahul about data vs job parallel)
 * - Traverse data once and compute the A matrix elements accordingly?
 *   Just like in permutation tests
